  // ## Drag handle styles

  // -webkit-touch-callout
  // A long press on anchors usually pops a content menu that has options for
  // the link such as 'Open in new tab'. Because long press is used to start
  // a drag we need to opt out of this behavior

  // -webkit-tap-highlight-color
  // Webkit based browsers add a grey overlay to anchors when they are active.
  // We remove this tap overlay as it is confusing for users
  // https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/remove-gray-highlight-when-tapping-links-in-mobile-safari/

  // touch-action: manipulation
  // Avoid the *pull to refresh action* and *delayed anchor focus* on Android Chrome

  // cursor: grab
  // We apply this by default for an improved user experience. It is such a common default that we
  // bake it right in. Consumers can opt out of this by adding a selector with higher specificity
  // The cursor will not apply when pointer-events is set to none

  // pointer-events: none
  // this is used to prevent pointer events firing on draggables during a drag
  // Reasons:
  // 1. performance: it stops the other draggables from processing mouse events
  // 2. scrolling: it allows the user to scroll through the current draggable
  // to scroll the list behind
  // 3.* function: it blocks other draggables from starting. This is not relied on though as there
  // is a function on the context (canLift) which is a more robust way of controlling this
