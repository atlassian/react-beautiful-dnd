# Changes while dragging

> For virtual list support see our [virtual list pattern](/docs/patterns/virtual-lists.md)

> ❌ **This behaviour is only supported in `11.x`**. We do plan on supporting this type of behaviour again in a future `minor` release. We needed to cut this existing behaviour order to get `12.x` across the line. Going forward, tree behaviour will be supported on the latest version. We know this sucks, but we thought it better to move things forward.

`react-beautiful-dnd` supports the addition and removal of `<Draggable />`s during a drag.

## What behaviours does this unlock?

### Lazy loading of list items

> In this example we are adding more `<Draggable />`s to a list we scroll closer to the bottom of the list

### Collapsing and expanding groups

> We recommend you use the [`@atlaskit/tree`](https://atlassian.design/components/table-tree) component for this behaviour

## Rules

> We attempt to print helpful debug information to the `console` if you do not follow these rules in development builds

- You are allowed to add or remove `Draggables` during a drag
- You can only add or remove `Draggables` that are of the same `type` as the dragging item.
- Any changes must occur within a `<Droppable />` that is a _scroll container_ (has `overflow: auto` or `overflow: scroll`). _This is prevent accidental shifts to other `Droppables` on the page_
- The size of the internal content of the _scroll container_ can change, but the outer bounds of the _scroll container_ itself cannot change.
- You cannot modify the sizes of any existing `<Draggable />` or `<Droppable />` during a drag
- You cannot add or remove a `<Droppable />` during a drag. _We did this to avoid accidental shifting of other `<Droppable />`s_
- When an item is removed or added it must be done instantly. You cannot animate the size of the item. You are welcome to animate a property when adding a `<Draggable />` that does not impact the size of the item, such as `opacity`

## `<DragDropContext /> > onDragUpdate` behavior

- `onDragUpdate` will be called if the `DragUpdate > source > index` of the dragging item has changed as the result of `Draggables` being added or removed before it.
- `onDragUpdate` will be called if the `DragUpdate > destination` of the dragging item has changed as a result of the addition or removal.

## `<DragDropContext /> > onDragEnd` behavior

`onDragEnd` will be called with values that are adjusted for any additions or removals of `Draggables` during a drag. This can mean that the `onDragStart: DragStart > source > index` can be different from the `onDragEnd: DropResult > source > index`.

### Sample `onDragEnd` flow

> What is important to note is that the `source` property can change during a drag as a result of dynamic changes.

1. A drag starts.

`onDragStart` is called with:

```js
{
  draggableId: 'item-1',,
  type: 'TYPE',
  source: {
    droppableId: 'droppable',
    index: 1,
  },
}
```

2. The first `<Draggable />` in the list (`item-0`) is removed.

`onDragUpdate` is called with `DragUpdate`:

```diff
{
  draggableId: 'item-1',,
  type: 'TYPE',
  source: {
    droppableId: 'droppable',
+   // item-1 is now in index 0 as item-0 is gone
+    index: 0,
  },
  // adjusted destination
  destination: null,
}
```

3. The drag ends

`onDragEnd` is called with `DropResult`:

```diff
{
  draggableId: 'item-1',,
  type: 'TYPE',
  source: {
    droppableId: 'droppable',
+   // the source reflects the change
+    index: 0,
  },
  destination: null,
  reason: 'DROP',
}
```

## Drag end while we are patching the virtual model

If a drag ends after a `<Draggable />` has been added or removed, but we have not finished collecting and patching the _virtual dimension model_ then we will delay the drop until the patch is finished. This is usually only a single frame. The `onDropEnd` callback will be called with a `DropResult` that is correct after the patch.
