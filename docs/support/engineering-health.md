## Typed

[![Typed with flow](https://img.shields.io/badge/typed%20with-flow-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://flow.org/)

This codebase is typed with [flow](https://flow.org) to promote greater internal consistency and more resilient code.

You can learn more about our `TypeScript` and `flow` support on our [types guide](/docs/guides/types.md).

## Tested

[![Tested with jest](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested_with-jest-99424f.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd) [![Tested with cypress](https://img.shields.io/badge/tested%20with-cypress-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://www.cypress.io/)

This code base employs a number of different testing strategies including unit, integration, browser and performance tests. Testing various aspects of the system helps to promote its quality and stability.

While code coverage is [not a guarantee of code health](https://stackoverflow.com/a/90021/1374236), it is a good indicator. This code base currently sits at **~94% coverage**.

## Linting

- [`eslint`](https://eslint.org/)
- [`stylelint`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint)
- [`prettier`](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - well, not strictly a linter, but close enough

Great care has been taken to keep the library as light as possible. There could be a smaller net cost if you were already using one of the underlying dependencies.
